 Java I/O is used to process the input and produce the output.
 Java program perform input and output through stream.
 A stream is linked to a physical device by the java I/O system to make input and output
operation in java.
 In general, Stream means continuous flow of data, a sequence of data.

1. Byte Stream I/O Classes Hierarchy
 Byte streams are defined by using two classes hierarchies.
 At the top are two abstract classes: InputStream and OutputStream.
 The InputStream is used to read data from a source.
 The OutputStream is used for writing data to a destination.

2.Character Stream I/O Classes Hierarchy
 Character stream are defined by using two classes hierarchies.
 At the top are two abstract classes: Reader and Writer.
 The Reader is used to read data from a source.
 The Writer is used for writing data to a destination.

To create a file use the following syntax:
 Ex:
File f = new File ("C:/java/hello.txt");

To open a file for reading, create object of FileInputStream.
 Ex:
FileInputStream f = new FileInputStream("C:/java/hello");

To open a file for writing, create object of FileOutputStream.
 Ex:
FileOutputStream f = new FileOutputStream("C:/java/hello");
